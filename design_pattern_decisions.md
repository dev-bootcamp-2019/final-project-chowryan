### <b>Design Pattern Requirements</b>
  - Implement Circuit Breaker - Wagers can be `Canceled` by the prediction market CEO in case a wager is ambiguous or invalid
- Other design patterns used:
  - Fail early and fail loud - reduce unnecessary code execution in the event that an exception will be thrown
  - Pull over Push Payments - protects against re-entrancy and denial of service attacks
  - State Machine - Wagers and Oracles have different options depending on current "Stage"
  - Upgradable - PredictionMarket.sol holds reference to contract factories and token address that can be swapped by the admin.
- Design patterns not used:
  - Auto Deprecation - unnecessary to have auto deprecation
  - Mortal - nobody should have ability to selfdestruct a Wager contract
  - Speed Bump - trading off speed of transactions not worth adding speed bump for withdraw
